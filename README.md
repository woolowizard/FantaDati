# FantaDati

<h1> What is that? </h1>

FantaDati is a scraping algorithm. Basically, you just need to instantiate the FantaDati.get_csv('championship_name') method to obtain as output a csv containing 107 features for each player of the specified championship.
For example, if I want to get the statistics of Serie A players in the 2023/2024 season I just need to write this line of code:
FantaDati.get_csv('seriea')
